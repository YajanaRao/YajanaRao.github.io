## Ayurvedic body type

Lately I have been observing disturbances in my health because of the season and as well as I could not be able to spend time on my health. After getting quite sick I considered to spend some time on understanding the Ayurvedic medicine system.

Before we taking  any medicine it is important to understand that health is not “one size fits all” proposition. It depends on unique nature of each person as well as the situation.

Talking about unique nature of each person, I have been trying to understand the nature of my body and mind. Most people struggle not to gain weight but my body type is such that, Whatever I eat I don’t gain an ounce of weight. I am a shy person and I struggle to cope up mood swings . These characteristics are of a vata person. 

### Vata body type:
People belong to this body find it difficult to gain weight. As they have fast metabolism, they are thin with prominent bony structure. Vata type people are known to be active, shy and low confidence. Their sleeping, eating and personal habits are irregular.

“People born with Vata dosha are usually active, creative and are gifted with the natural ability to express and communicate. They are also quick learners, have a lively and fun personality, and are full of joy and enthusiasm when in balance. But when their vata goes out of balance, they start showing tendencies to act on impulse, mood swings and respond to stress with fear, anxiety and worry.”

Winter is known to be hard on vata type people.

Some precessions to be taken are maintaining a strict schedule are.
1. Sleep well.
2. Consume oily foods. Oily foods known to reduce vata.
3. Maintain a strict schedule for food, sleep and excirse.
