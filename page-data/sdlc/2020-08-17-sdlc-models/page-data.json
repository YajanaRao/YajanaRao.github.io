It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called <strong>sprints</strong>, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks. The Scrum Team track progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings, called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds sprint review, to demonstrate the work done, and sprint retrospective to continuously improve.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"SDLC Models","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/sdlc/2020-08-17-sdlc-models/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/technical/2020-07-19-time-based-greeting/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Greet user based on time of the day"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/queries/2020-08-01-integrate-react-native-web-to-existing-application/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Integrate react-native-web in an existing react native application"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1246554614","1250528154","280171546","2841359383"]}
