## Welcome to Yajana's Pages

I use the [website](https://github.com/YajanaRao/yajanarao.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for what I learn during the software development and sometime general stuff in Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/YajanaRao/yajanarao.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
